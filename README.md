# Employee Attrition Prediction
This project uses machine learning models (Random Forest & SVM) to predict employee attrition based on HR data.  
The goal is to help companies identify factors that influence employee turnover and take preventive actions.

- Predict employee attrition using Random Forest and SVM.
- Feature importance analysis.
- Comparison of different SVM kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF).
- Accuracy, precision, recall evaluation.

  
Insights:
- Random Forest achieved ~80% accuracy, but due to data imbalance the results are more biased.
- SVM RBF kernel performed best (~86% accuracy). But the execution time is soo long...
- Feature scaling significantly improved SVM performance.
- Suggestion: Reduce overtime and improve job satisfaction to lower attrition rates.
